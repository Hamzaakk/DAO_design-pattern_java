# Java DAO Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic Data Access Object (DAO) pattern in Java for interacting with a MySQL database. It includes a simple entity class (`Stagiere`), a DAO interface (`StagiereDAO`), and a corresponding implementation class (`StagiereDAOImpl`). The application showcases CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JDBC for database interactions.

The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern separates the data access code from the business logic, promoting modularity and maintainability in software applications. It encapsulates the interaction with a data source (like a database) and provides a standardized interface for accessing and managing data.
